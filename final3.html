<p>Kanye West was born in Atlanta and raised in Chicago. He is an American rapper, record producer, entrepreneur, and fashion designer. After claiming that the name Ye has religious significance to him, the musician and fashion designer formally changed his name to Ye in October 2021. With 135 million albums sold worldwide, the critically acclaimed singer is one of the best-selling artists of all time. In the early 2000s, West rose to prominence as a producer for Roc-A-Fella Records, delivering successful singles for artists such as Jay-Z, Ludacris, and Alicia Keys. He went on to have a solo career as a rapper, and his debut album, "The College Dropout," was published in 2004. West's outspoken beliefs and personal life have gotten a lot of attention outside of music, thanks to his past marriage to TV celebrity Kim Kardashian. As a fashion designer, he developed the Yeezy brand, which led to collaborations with Adidas and other well known brands including Nike, Louis Vuitton, and the Gap. West also is the founder of a creative company named DONDA, which is named after his late mother Donda West.  West also recently opened up Donda Academy, a school under his mother's name (People, n.d.).

<p>Ritt Momney is an American musician from Salt Lake City, Utah, who's real name is Jack Rutter.  Mitt Romney, an American politician who has served as a United States senator from Utah, inspired the stage name. Ritt Momney was the title of an indie band started by Rutter during high school, however after his friends left to become Mormon missionaries, he proceeded with the name as a solo act. Rutter produced a cover of "Put Your Records On," which was published on April 24, 2020, first independently, and then through Disruptor Records and Columbia Records. After growing in popularity on the video sharing app TikTok in September 2020, the song became a hidden success. It reached number 30 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States. The track also peaked in the top 10 charts of New Zealand and Australia (Wikipedia, 2021).
