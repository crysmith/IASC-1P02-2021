	<h3 class="grow">What is music?</h3>
	<p>Sounds are all around us, from birds chirping and waves lapping against a coastline to cars honking in traffic. But sometimes sounds are put together in purposeful ways to create a specific atmosphere or to express ideas or emotions. Such organized sounds are called music.
To accurately describe what music is, I have taken a section from the  study.com website. Music is a collection of coordinated sound or sounds. Making music is the process of putting sounds and tones in an order, often combining them to create a unified composition. People who make music creatively organize sounds for a desired result, like a Beethoven symphony or one of Duke Ellington's jazz songs. Music is made of sounds, vibrations, and silent moments, and it doesn't always have to be pleasant or pretty. It can be used to convey a whole range of experiences, environments, and emotions.
Music includes works played by jazz bands

Almost every human culture has a tradition of making music. Examples of early instruments like flutes and drums have been found dating back thousands of years. Ancient Egyptians used music in religious ceremonies. Many other African cultures have traditions related to drumming for important rituals. Today, rock and pop musicians tour and perform around the world, singing the songs that made them famous. All of these are examples of music.

<h3 class="grow">What does music mean to me?</h3>
<p>Music is very important to me as it is quite a large part of my identity. I do not go a single day without listening to music and it consumes quite a large portion of my life. Music to me is many things, it is a way to relieve stress when I am feeling down, it is a way to make a hangout with friends even more enjoyable, it is in a way therapy to me. I listen to multiple genres of music each having a different affect on me. Music can be used as a way to escape from the world just as much as  it can be used to grow more connected to it. There is something in music for everyone. Music and different musical artists have truly helped me in my life as their words and sounds allow me to express and release emotions and help me move on from anything that is bothering me or weighing on me.
