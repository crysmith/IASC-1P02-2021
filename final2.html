Kanye West's critically acclaimed Late Registration, is his second studio album. It was published by Def Jam Recordings and Roc-A-Fella Records on August 30, 2005. In partnership with music producer and film score musician Jon Brion, West recorded the album over the span of a year in studios in California and New York City. Adam Levine, Jamie Foxx, Common, Brandy, Jay-Z, and Nas were among the guests that contributed to the studio sessions. Late Registration's production was a different take from West's previous and debut album, The College Dropout, which included sped-up soul samples, in favour of a more intricate, upbeat sound. He experimented with new jazz type sampling methods, string orchestration under the influence and genius of Brion, and a variety of instruments not typically associated with classic hip hop music. This caused West to draw creative inspiration from alternative acts such as Fiona Apple and Portishead. West used storytelling tactics and a persona distinguished by humour, passion, and sadness to address both personal and bigger geopolitical themes in an effort to compose honest but approachable lyrics. He also explored his contradictory link between Christianity and freedom, resulting in topical songs that challenge sources of inequity such as institutional racism, higher education, health care, drug trafficking, and the blood diamond trade (Wikipedia, 2021).

<p>This album is my favourite album of all time and I hold it very dear to my heart. I believe it to be one of, if not the best demonstration of a hip-hop album that exists.</p>

<p>The 13-track record puts an extremely personal spin on the tumultuous experience of leaving home for the first time and confronting the death of familiarity that we all go through. Overall, the piece is a cathartic release following a heartbreak and an investigation of grief as an emotion, while chronologically it charts the emotional phases that finally led singer and songwriter Jack Rutter to accept his predicament. Rutter recognised connections between two issues he believed were primarily unconnected throughout the writing process, a breakup with a longtime girlfriend and a disconnection with the church in the aftermath of the album's release, prompting more self-reflection. (Genius, 2020)</p>
<p>This album is an amazing example of how you don't need money or to be successful to make something amazing. This is a spectacular album from a great young artist in the making.</p>

<p>Swimming is a difficulut album to describe, I have added a section from the pitchfork.com review in order to do it justice. At its lightest, Swimming plays a little like Mac Miller’s own Forgetting Sarah Marshall, an amiable account of involuntary bachelorhood. “I know I probably need to do better, fuck whoever, keep my shit together,” he ambles over an aloof beat on “Smaller Worlds.” On “What’s the Use,” he shrugs off his foibles over some buoyant roller-disco, accompanied by low-key vocal assists from Snoop Dogg and Thundercat. Miller’s flow is limber and self-deprecating; he tries any pattern of singing or rapping that might lift his spirits for a few seconds. He’s doing his best to find the humor in a situation that isn’t really funny, as his arrest for a DUI and hit and run this May made all too clear.

Miller has long been open about his struggles with addiction, which Grande cited in her decision to end what she called a “toxic relationship.” But those looking for any dirt-dishing or ax-grinding on Swimming will be disappointed. “Everybody want a headline, I don’t got nothin’ to say,” he rapped on “Programs,” a loose track from May with more of a chip on its shoulder than any that made the album. Even at Swimming’s bleakest—“Self Care/Oblivion,” a dispiriting account of his pain-numbing regime, or “Hurt Feelings,” which shines some light on his mental state during that DUI—Miller resists the suggestion that anybody in particular is to blame for him bottoming out. The furthest he’ll go is acknowledging life was a lot easier with Grande than without her. “She put me back together when I was out of order,” he admits on “Perfecto.” (Rytlewski, 2018). Swimming is an extremely innovative album especially for someone like Mac Miller. Miller unfortunately passed away not long after this albums release, and to this day it is one of the greatest records I have ever heard.
